# How do vocoders work?

This repository containts a few experiments on vocoders (or at least, early vocoders). How were they first used to reconstruct speech, and how could they be used in music?

I also wrote a [blog post](www.rsmit.co.za/blog/vocoders_part_1) giving some background on the topic of vocoders.
